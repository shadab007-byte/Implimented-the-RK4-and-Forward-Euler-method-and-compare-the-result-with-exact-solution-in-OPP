# Implimenting-the-RK4-and-Forward-Euler-method-and-comparing-the-result-with-exact-solution-in-OPP
# Numerical ODE Solvers in C++

This project implements numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using C++. It is part of an assignment at IIT Madras for the Object-Oriented Programming course.

## ðŸ“Œ Methods Implemented
- **Forward Euler Method**
- **Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4)**

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualization
The solution is computed and plotted to analyze accuracy based on different step sizes. A sample output is shown below:
